This is a little program, that should help you win in any hangman game.

It's database contains around ~22.000 russian nouns. It's more than enough for most cases.

In database there are not only words, but there is a frequency of appearence of a word near every of them.
So mechanism not only suggests words that fit, but most frequent of them.

Empty symbol can be represented as any symbol on your keyboard, not only '_' as in example.
Simirarly used letters can be also separated with any symbol or sequence of symbols.

If you notice lack of some frequent word, it would be nice of you, if you send me a pull request
with that word.

You can try this out here: https://gregorykogan.github.io/hangman-helper/

It currently supports only Russian language.
